                <h3>Internet Ninja</h3>
                <p>I’m a young ‘internet ninja’ who loves working remotely. The initial branch of IT that I started working on was Web Development. Then I got into security, marketing, etc.</p>
                <p>Nowadays I’m focusing on helping new businesses with their online appearance and boosting their online awareness.</p>
                <p>And also, helping IT newcomers to understand what it takes to work remotely and live life with your own rules.</p>
